Understanding individual learning styles—visual, auditory, and kinesthetic—can help improve how students absorb and retain information. Each student has a unique preference for learning, and tailoring teaching methods to these styles can enhance learning outcomes. In this project, we aim to predict a student's learning style using their visual, auditory, and kinesthetic scores.

We use a supervised machine learning approach to classify students based on their sensory scores. The dataset includes labeled data for each student’s learning style along with their corresponding scores. A Random Forest Classifier is trained to make predictions, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics. This project shows how machine learning can support more personalized education by identifying learning preferences automatically.
