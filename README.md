This project presents a comprehensive analysis of student learning styles — Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic — using an educational dataset.
It begins with an extensive data cleaning phase, ensuring the dataset is pristine and well-structured for further analysis. The study proceeds with detailed visualizations, offering clear insights into the distribution of different learning styles among students.

Beyond basic statistics, this project delves into the comparative evaluation of average performance scores across different learning methods.
By calculating and interpreting the mean scores derived from visual, auditory, and kinesthetic assessments, the project reveals meaningful patterns that highlight how learning preferences may impact academic performance.

Through meticulous exploration and polished visual storytelling, this project not only aids in understanding student behavior but also serves as a foundational reference for educators aiming to personalize teaching strategies based on dominant learning styles.
